My journey Learning C. 
I have decided to learn C, following the classic version of The C Programming Language (1978), written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.
I am following the reading of the book in the video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-_s8f5K30I&t=2954s) tutorial created by freeCodeCamp (https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
and Charles Severance (Dr. Chuck - https://www.cc4e.com/).
Thank you all.

/*
This is the first C program in the book which is the classic "hello world". This first program witll not work (compile/run) in my linux desktop,in which I am running ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS, because the standard is too old. 
Modifications are necessary.

#include <stdio.h>
main()
{

	printf("Hello, world\n");
}
